##HTTP!
- An application level protocol.
- *Hypertext*: Transferring files which contains text which links to another text but then it got evolved into *Hypermedia* in which a text links to any media such as Image, Video or Audio.
- URIs, URNs and URLs indicates the resource where the methods [get, post, head, put, delete] should be applied.
- To keep it short, URI(indicates location or name of the resource) has two specializations URN(indicates name of the resource) and URL(indicates location of the resource).
- Everything you’ve ever looked at on the web — HTML pages, images, scripts, videos, PDFs, anything with a URL — has been served to you with a specific MIME type in the Content-Type header. For example, *Content-Type: text/html*.
- MIME (like content negotiation) is a feature of HTTP where a client (like a web browser) tells the server (like a web server) what types of resources it supports (like image/jpeg) so the server can return something in the client’s preferred format.
- Browsers have always been forgiving to HTML except the times when there was XHTML 1.0 which led to strict syntax checking (called as draconian error handling).
- In 2004, the major Web browsers decided to make their own way and not be entirely dependent on W3C. Thus, born WHATWG.
- WHATWG is a loose, unofficial, and open collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties. The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.
